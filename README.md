# CRUD-operations-using:(Express-Mongoose)

*This is the Sample CURD operations website which uses following technologies:

*Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the factor standard server framework for Node.js.

*EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

*Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.

*MongoDB is a document-oriented database which stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. It means you can store your records without worrying about the data structure such as the number of fields or types of fields to store values.

For making this Website we use Express framework as Server side language and also used EJS which is simple templating language, and some NPM packages from nodejs. And also used Mongoose library(ODM), to interact directly with MongoDB database which the website is less interactive but works effectively!.
